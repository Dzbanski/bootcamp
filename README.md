# Function is_palindrom

This project contains function is_palindrom which return information is string a palindrome.
At the beginning it converts string letters to lowercase, because without it function could have problems with compare strings.
Next we try to return true or false. We do that comparing string with his reversed version. We use slicing to reverse string. [::-1]
